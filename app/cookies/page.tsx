        <p>
          Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile) when you visit a
          website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to the website
          owners.

            <strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly. They
            enable basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website. The website cannot
            function properly without these cookies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Preference Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as
            your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website
            by collecting and reporting information anonymously. This helps us improve our website.

          <li>
            <strong>Functional Cookies:</strong> These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and
            personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our
